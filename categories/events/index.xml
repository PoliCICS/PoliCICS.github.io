The Summer School in Social Complexity Sciences emerges as the evolution of the 2019–2020 research camps. Today it is an intensive learning space that expands the methodological tools of students and researchers. Since 2023, it has been open to participants from other postgraduate programs and external institutions, consolidating itself as an interdisciplinary meeting point and a link with the community.
