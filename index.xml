The estimates are based exclusively on roll-call votes related to bill proposals debated and voted on in the plenary sessions. It excludes other types of votes, such as those on non-binding agreements or investigative commissions, which do not directly contribute to lawmaking.

Contrary to this tradition, contemporary science has accumulated compelling evidence that social interaction is conditioned by biological, psychological, economic, and evolutionary factors.
An adequate understanding of the complexity of social systems requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates insights from distinct theoretical and methodological frameworks.
Computational Social Science At PoliCICS, we model social phenomena using a diverse array of advanced techniques, making extensive use of the digital footprint left by human interactions.</description></item><item><title>Success</title><link>https://policics.github.io/contact/success/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://policics.github.io/contact/success/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
