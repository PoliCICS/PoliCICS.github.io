Its mission is to provide a dynamic and flexible environment for conducting innovative research addressing complex social challenges. In this laboratory, students, postdocs, academics, and national and international collaborators linked to CICS gather to work on interdisciplinary projects, all with a common focus: the use of experimental methods in social sciences.</description></item><item><title>Web Design</title><link>https://policics.github.io/research/web-design/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:15:34 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://policics.github.io/research/web-design/</guid><description>Creating Modern Websites Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.

These instances constitute a fundamental space for discussing research progress, piloting experimental designs, and presenting work by both our researchers and national and international guests. Below you can see the record of the sessions held during the 2025 academic cycle.
