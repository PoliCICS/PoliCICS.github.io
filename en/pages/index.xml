Contrary to this tradition, contemporary science has accumulated compelling evidence that social interaction is conditioned by biological, psychological, economic, and evolutionary factors.
An adequate understanding of the complexity of social systems requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates insights from distinct theoretical and methodological frameworks.
Computational Social Science At PoliCICS, we model social phenomena using a diverse array of advanced techniques, making extensive use of the digital footprint left by human interactions.</description></item></channel></rss>
