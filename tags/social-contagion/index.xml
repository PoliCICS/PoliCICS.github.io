Beyond the initial adoption of modern contraceptives, this work investigates the social dynamics of disadoption, understood as the decision to cease using a modern method. The work is being developed by Aníbal Olivera in collaboration with Thomas Valente, a world reference in the study of networks and health.
The analysis was carried out in three main stages to ensure rigor and build upon established findings.</description></item></channel></rss>
