This dataset provides systematic estimates of the ideological positions of all members of the Chilean Chamber of Deputies across six consecutive legislative periods.
The estimates are based exclusively on roll-call votes related to bill proposals debated and voted on in plenary sessions, offering a robust tool for legislative analysis.</description></item></channel></rss>
